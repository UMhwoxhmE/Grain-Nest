/**
 * Round 8 / phase-r8a: nest jobs — choose which pieces go into a nest from
 * the cut codes in their names, without deleting the rest.
 *
 * Dressmaking context: one garment is usually cut from several
 * fabrics — the main ("fashion") fabric, lining, ribbing, interfacing (a
 * stiffening layer ironed onto some pieces). Each fabric is a separate
 * nest. Pieces are named like "16 Hood Facing C2M C2I" where each code is
 * C<count><material>[OF]: "C2M" = cut 2 main, "C1IOF" = cut 1 interfacing on
 * the fold. The rules for which nest a piece belongs to (round 8):
 *
 * - Main:        any M code, unless the piece is Fused (below).
 * - Fused:       same number of M and I (e.g. C2M C2I). A block of main fabric
 *                is bulk-fused with interfacing and these are cut from
 *                it, because interfacing pieces cut separately warp.
 * - Interfacing: fewer I than M (e.g. C2M C1I — the 1I is cut separately and
 *                halved), interfacing-only pieces (no M), and every piece
 *                named "INT<n> …" (pattern interfacing pieces).
 * - Lining:      any L code.        - Ribbing: any R code.
 * - All:         everything (the only job that includes pieces without
 *                recognised codes).
 *
 * Counts are NOT used to set quantities: a "cut 2" piece is normally a
 * piece plus its mirror copy (two rows sharing a name), so jobs only switch
 * rows in or out (`part.excluded`). Pure functions, no DOM — unit-testable.
